# 🧬 Blockchain-Based Genome Ownership System

![DNA Animation](https://media.giphy.com/media/26n6WywJyh39n1pBu/giphy.gif)

A **decentralized genome ownership** platform that utilizes **blockchain technology** to securely store and manage genetic data. This system allows individuals to mint **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** that represent and prove ownership of their genomic information.

> ⚠️ Genetic data is extremely sensitive — this project aims to give control back to the data owners while ensuring immutability and transparency through blockchain.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates a prototype solution to a growing problem in the digital healthcare and personal genomics space: **how to securely store, verify, and transfer ownership of genetic data**. Traditional systems rely on centralized servers and opaque data policies. In contrast, this system:

- Gives individuals **ownership of their genome** using NFTs.
- Leverages **smart contracts** for secure, programmable data management.
- Promotes **decentralization**, making data manipulation or unauthorized access nearly impossible.
- Ensures **transparency** while preserving **privacy** through encryption and on-chain metadata.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Mint **genome NFTs** representing a user's genetic profile.
- ✅ **Immutable** and **transparent** records of data ownership on the blockchain.
- ✅ Basic smart contracts for **access control** and verification.
- ✅ Roadmap to store **encrypted data on decentralized storage** (IPFS).
- ✅ Foundations laid for building a **genetic data marketplace**.

## 🧠 Why Use Blockchain for Genomics?

| Problem | Centralized Systems | Blockchain-Based System |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 🧬 **Data Ownership** | Held by labs/companies | Owned by the individual |
| 🛡️ **Security** | Vulnerable to data breaches | Immutable and verifiable |
| 🔐 **Access Control** | Vague or non-existent | Managed via smart contracts |
| 🧾 **Transparency** | Black box | Open and auditable |
| 💰 **Data Monetization** | Companies profit | Individual can profit ethically |

> Genomic data is not just data — it's your biological fingerprint. You deserve to control it.

## ⚠️ Risks & Ethical Considerations

While decentralization and blockchain add powerful security and ownership tools, the nature of genetic data introduces **ethical and technical risks**:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ❌ **Data Leakage** | Once leaked, genetic data can't be "revoked." |
| 🎯 **Discrimination** | Employers, insurers, or governments could misuse genome info. |
| 🧬 **Irreversible Storage** | Data on-chain cannot be edited or deleted. |
| 💰 **Commodification** | Treating human DNA as a tradable asset may raise moral questions. |
| ⚖️ **Informed Consent** | Users must fully understand risks before sharing their genome. |

> ⚖️ We encourage community participation to build governance frameworks around data ethics.
